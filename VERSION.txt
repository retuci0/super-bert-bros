------------ CHANGELOG FOR v1.1 [9/IV/24] ------------
------------------------------------------------------


Added:
    Fixed a bug where you could drag the opponent towards you instead of pushing it back when throwing a projectile and changing direction quickly
    Better project structure (added folders instead of just keeping all files in the root dir)
    A weight attribute to determine how much knockback each character takes (e. g.: 1 --> default, 1.5 --> lighter, 0.5 --> heavier)
    Player names, in the part where health and lives are shown. Still very crappy
    Made player names and characters save when you change characters


To add yet:
    Multiple scenarios
    Actual functionality to attack and damage sprites
    More SFX and music
    Actual double jump, not the glitch
    Melee attacks (imagine still having to add attacks in a fighting game)
    Special attacks (like in the smashing bros game omg omg nintendo gunna sue me)
    Fix shit ig


Known issues:
    Player names don't save in the characters selection screen, which means if player 1 is named "d", when you change characters, in the name field, it won't show "d",
        even though it's supposed to
    Players can still double jump when spamming the jump button, and for some reason they are more likely to do it when the cursor is moving or
        both players are jumping at the same time. I'm not sure why the last part is a thing, but I know you can double jump because in the jump method,
        it checks if you're colliding with a platform, and if so, it sets your dy to 0. Then, it checks if your dy is 0, and if it is, you jump. But you're
        at yor highest point in the air (when the actual jump ends), before you fall, your dy is 0, because you don't move for like a frame, before falling again.
        If you happen to call the jump method right at that point, you will double jump.
    Players get instantly tp'd to the top of a platform if they collide with it's sides (yes, it's a bug)
    Hitboxes are not aligned perfectly with the player when it's moving or jumping
    Projectiles can traspass the big platform
    Game might crash with code 3489660927 when you spam projectiles. I've got no clue why, but it might
