# super bert bros (please don't sue me nintendo)

crappy cringe game made by retucio (retuci0) and his boredom, feel free to use as a template for your own crappier game, give credit if so.

## controls (they're uncomfortable ik): 

### player 1 (the one that spawns in the left side)

> a, d and space to move

> e to shoot a projectile

### player 2 (the one that doesn't spawn in the left side lmao)

> arrow keys to move

> rctrl to shoot a projectile

### other

> b to toggle hitboxes

> esc for the pause menu

> 0 to quit (you can also quit in the pause menu)

### to change the key binds, go to [the key_bindings.py file](key_bindings.py) and change them there.


## hitbox colors meaning:

> red --> player

> blue --> platform

> green --> projectile
